:bulb: Since the emergence of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention, with new advancements continuously emerging. LLMs have found applications in various domains like vision, audio, and text tasks. However, **tabular data** remains a crucial data format in this world. Hence, this repo focuses on collecting research papers that explore the integration of LLM technology with tabular data, and aims to save you valuable time and boost research efficiency.

:sparkles: Awesome-LLM-Tabular is a curated list of **Large Language Model** applied to **Tabular Data**.

:fire: This project is currently under development. Feel free to :star: (STAR) and :telescope: (WATCH) it to stay updated on the latest developments.
