# Summarization

## Approach
The approach proposed in this paper, called PTab, uses a pre-trained language model to learn contextual representations of tabular data. PTab consists of three stages of processing: Modality Transformation, Masked-Language Fine-tuning, and Classification Fine-tuning. The model is initialized with a pre-trained model that contains semantic information learned from large-scale language data. PTab can naturally mix textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set and improve the representation learning. The experiments show that PTab outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both supervised and semi-supervised settings in terms of average AUC scores. The visualization analysis shows that PTab can effectively select features by attention mechanism and learn contextual representation from textualized tabular data.

## Experiment
The experiments in this paper evaluate the performance of the PTab framework on eight popular tabular classification datasets. The results show that PTab outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, such as XGBoost, in supervised settings and achieves better average AUC scores. PTab also outperforms counterpart methods under semi-supervised settings. The visualization analysis shows that PTab can effectively select features by attention mechanism and learn contextual representation from textualized tabular data. Overall, the experiments demonstrate that PTab is a promising approach for improving the accuracy of models that use tabular data.
