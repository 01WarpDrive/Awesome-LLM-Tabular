# Summarization

## Introduction

- **Context**: Tabular data, encompassing diverse domains, often lacks contextual information for effective analysis. This limitation is typically addressed through feature engineering (FE), which involves transforming existing features to create new data representations. A significant challenge in FE is integrating external unstructured data into tabular datasets.

- **Solution Proposed**: The paper introduces the FeSTE framework, leveraging transformer-based pre-trained Language Models (LM) to enrich tabular datasets by extracting and generating new features from unstructured data. This approach aims to provide a more robust and effective solution for datasets of varying sizes, including those with limited data​​.

## Problem Definition

- **Assumptions**: The framework assumes a target tabular dataset with classification tasks and a set of pre-analyzed datasets with various classifications. It utilizes an external data source (EX) comprising entities and related texts. The primary goal is to generate new features from these texts using a Language Model (LM)​​.

## Proposed Method

- **Three Phases**: FeSTE's methodology consists of three main phases:
    - **Entity Linking Phase**: This involves matching entities in the tabular dataset with corresponding entries in external data sources like Wikipedia, using tools like Google Search for linking and disambiguation.
    - **Fine-Tuning Phase**: Adapts state-of-the-art NLP architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT) to select relevant features from linked external source entities. It involves creating a unified representation for all datasets by pairing texts with all possible target class values, treating it as a sentence-pairs classification problem.
    - **Features Generation Phase**: Focuses on generating new features that augment the target dataset. It involves predicting the likelihood of texts being related to each of the target dataset’s classes and adding these as new features to the dataset​​.

## Experiment

The experiment results for the paper on Few-Shot Tabular Data Enrichment Using Fine-Tuned Transformer Architectures (FeSTE) are comprehensive and reveal significant findings. The experiments were conducted in two main sets:

- **Evaluating the Efficacy of the Fine-Tuning (FT) Method**: This set aimed to assess the effectiveness of FeSTE's novel FT approach compared to two leading baselines: target-dataset FT and MT-DNN. In this experiment, classifiers were trained only on features generated from the external data source (DBpedia unstructured text), excluding the original dataset features. The results showed that FeSTE performs well across all FT methods, with the proposed reformulation approach outperforming the baselines in 10 out of 17 datasets. In terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC), the Reformulated FT improved upon the baselines by 4.7%-6.8%. This improvement was found to be statistically significant with a p-value < 0.001. Notably, the reformulated FT approach showed a larger relative improvement for smaller datasets.

- **Evaluating FeSTE with Original Features and Additional Entity Linking Approaches**: This set of experiments aimed to test the generic nature of FeSTE, particularly its performance with different entity linking approaches. Two versions of FeSTE were evaluated: one using a Google-based entity linking approach and the other implementing the FGSES entity linking approach. The results were compared with the performance achieved by only the original dataset features. Both versions of FeSTE significantly outperformed the original set of features, achieving better performances in 10 out of 17 datasets. On average, FeSTE outperformed the results obtained by the original features by 9.2% and 5.2% for the Google-based and FGSES-based entity linking, respectively. These results were also statistically significant with p < 0.001 compared to the original set of features.
