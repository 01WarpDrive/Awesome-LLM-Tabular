The paper presents TableQuery, a new tool for querying tabular data using natural language. Unlike existing deep learning models for question answering on tabular data, TableQuery uses pre-trained models on free text, which eliminates the need for fine-tuning when the data domain changes. The tool allows users to query large datasets without memory restrictions by storing tables into a database or spreadsheet. The system architecture of TableQuery is described, including the main modules and how they are connected. The paper also shares qualitative results from experiments conducted on the WikiSQL dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of TableQuery. Overall, TableQuery provides a more efficient and user-friendly solution for querying tabular data using natural language.
