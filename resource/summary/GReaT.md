# Summarization

## Approach
This paper introduces GReaT, a novel approach to generating highly realistic tabular data using auto-regressive generative large language models. GReaT allows the end-user to have full probabilistic control over the sampling procedure by its arbitrary conditioning power, utilizes the knowledge from large text databases to obtain a better representation that includes context knowledge, and is easy to use, since it does not require a preprocessing of the data values. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments. The authors also provide an ethics statement, encouraging possible owners of proprietary data sets to verify that reverse identification is impossible or is prevented by regulatory means before sharing any data.

## Experiment
The authors of this paper conducted multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GReaT approach for generating highly realistic tabular data. They evaluated the performance of GReaT on various real-world and synthetic data sets and compared it with other state-of-the-art generative models. The authors also provided information on the packages and parameters for the selected LLMs for better reproducibility. The results of the experiments showed that GReaT outperformed other generative models in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and information loss.
